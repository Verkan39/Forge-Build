## Contract Address:
for the deployed Ledger contract, the contract address is "0xe277ee27278469a1c1bfc7a21624aabfc4302138"

## Deployment Steps:
created an API key using Alchemy,on Etherium Sepholia network
added my private key to the ".env" and ensured that .env is listed on gitignore
added the rpc to founry.toml
wrote a deployement script
ran the foundry command with my private key to deploy it to Sepholia
